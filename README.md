### Project Aim
Scrape all songs from my spotify playlist. 

Use k_means to group and reorganise the songs into new playlists.

A user can provide any song and artist, then the algorithm will suggest the best playlist for the tack and finally provoding a sample track from the playlist using youtube. 

### Technologies 
- Python 3.6
- JSON
- Spotipy
- Selenium 
- API

### Build a Model

Classification model used was:
* K_means

### Project Status
Project has finished, and was done in 5 days. I can now reorganise my playlists according to song features rather than what I think works best. In the future to improve this project I will better decide which features are relevant to the model.
